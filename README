README

visualearth will generate an image of the world as it currently looks from space.
Ok, it's not completely accurate, but it's good enough for a dynamic desktop wallpaper.
Initially inspired by http://www.die.net/earth/



REQUIREMENTS
You will need wget, imagemagick, xplanet, and perl. If you're using a system with apt as
the package manager, you can install these packages using:
	sudo apt-get install wget imagemagick xplanet perl libwww-perl

If you want to use makevideo.sh, you also need ffmpeg:
	sudo apt-get install ffmpeg



INSTALLATION
In order to get it all working, simply run initialize.sh, which will download all
the appropriate images used. You only need to do this once. If you want to use
different images, simply edit the xplanet.config file, or replace the images in the
images directory.

Once the images have all been downloaded, simply run generate.sh, which will
select a day image based on your current month, and generate a mercator projected
image of the planet, crop it, and resize. By default it resizes to 1920x1080,
and you may want to change that to fit your needs. See USAGE below.

generate.sh will create a directory called render

Once you're ready to have it all running automatically, simply add an entry
like this to your crontab:

*/5  *    * * *   yourusername    cd /path/to/visualearth/ && ./generate.sh

(remember to change username and path)

This will generate a new image every 5 minutes. download_clouds.pl will only
download new cloud data every two hours. Please don't change this, there is
no point, cloud data is not super live! You will only end up hammering
someone's server.

Enjoy!



USAGE
generate.sh accepts the following options:
	--save
		Causes the script to make a timestamped copy of the generated image
	--size=###x###
		Sets the final size of the generated image



VIDEO
The makevideo.sh script allows you to generate video from a series of images.
In order to use it, you need to use the --save flag on generate.sh.
